# Chef Knife Plugin for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
[![wercker status](https://app.wercker.com/status/82cc98510b6b52b3a37d1212174a1d56/s/master "wercker status")](https://app.wercker.com/project/byKey/82cc98510b6b52b3a37d1212174a1d56)

## About

The knife-oci plugin allows users to interact with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure through [Chef Knife](https://docs.chef.io/knife.html).

The project is open source and maintained by Oracle Corp. The home page for the project is [here](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/SDKDocs/knifeplugin.htm).

**_Breaking Change Notice:_** Information about the recent name change from knife-bmcs to knife-oci can be found [here](docs/rename.md).

## Commands

- Launch an OCI instance and bootstrap it as a Chef node:
  `knife oci server create`
- List OCI compartments.
  `knife oci compartment list`
- Delete an OCI instance:
  `knife oci server delete`
- List OCI instances in a given compartment. **Note:** All instances in the compartment are returned, not only those that are Chef nodes:
  `knife oci server list`
- List the images in a compartment:
  `knife oci image list`
- List the VCNs in a compartment:
  `knife oci vcn list`
- List the subnets in a VCN:
  `knife oci subnet list`
- List the shapes that may be used for a particular image type:
  `knife oci shape list`
- List the availability domains for your tenancy:
  `knife oci ad list`

## Installation

Install from RubyGems with:

    chef gem install knife-oci

Or:

    gem install knife-oci

**Note:** The plugin depends on the OCI Ruby SDK. Information about that SDK can be found [here](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/SDKDocs/rubysdk.htm).

## Setup

A config file is required to use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure commands. See the instructions for creating a config file [here](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm).

By default, the config file will be loaded from ~/.oci/config. Alternate locations can be provided as an argument to each command using `--oci-config-file`, or as an entry in your knife.rb file. You can also specify a profile with `--oci-profile`.

## Setting the Compartment

Most OCI commands require a compartment ID, which will default to the root compartment. If you do not have the correct permissions and you do not specify a different compartment, then you will receive an authorization error.

A compartment ID can be provided with each OCI command using `--compartment-id`, or it can be provided in your knife.rb. If a compartment ID is set in both places, then the ID specified in the command will take precedence.

## Knife.rb values

The following example shows the available knife.rb settings for the OCI Knife Plugin. All of these are optional.

    knife[:oci_config_file] = '~/.oci/my_alternate_config'
    knife[:oci_profile] = 'MY_ALTERNATE_PROFILE'
    knife[:compartment_id] = 'ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaaaalsyenka3grgpvvmqwjshig5abzx3jnbvixxxzx373ehwdj7o5arc'

## Using the Server Create Command

The following example shows how to launch and bootstrap an Oracle Linux image:

    knife oci server create
      --availability-domain 'kIdk:PHX-AD-1'
      --compartment-id 'ocidv1:tenancy:oc1:phx:1460406592660:aaaaaaaab4faofrfkxecohhjuivjq26a13'
      --image-id 'ocid1.image.oc1.phx.aaaaaaaaqutj4qjxihpl4mboabsa27mrpusygv6gurp47katabcvljmq3puq'
      --shape 'VM.Standard1.1'
      --subnet-id 'ocid1.subnet.oc1.phx.aaaaaaaaxlc5cv7ewqr343ms4lvcpxr4lznsf4cbs2565abcm23d3cfebrex'
      --ssh-authorized-keys-file ~/.keys/instance_keys.pub
      --display-name myinstance
      --identity-file ~/.keys/instance_keys
      --run-list 'recipe[my_cookbook::my_recipe]'
      --region us-phoenix-1

When using the `knife oci server create` command, you must specify a public key using `--ssh-authorized-keys-file` and the corresponding private key using `--identity-file`. For more information, see [Managing Key Pairs on Linux Instances](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Compute/Tasks/managingkeypairs.htm).

Notes about the `knife oci server create` command:

 - All Oracle-provided Linux images are supported. Windows images are not supported at this time.
 - Bootstrapping is done through SSH only, and uses the public IP address.
 - For Ubuntu images, the user is usually 'ubuntu' instead of 'opc'.
