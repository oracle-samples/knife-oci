# Chef Knife Plugin for Oracle BMCS

## About

The knife-bmcs plugin allows users to interact with Oracle Bare Metal Cloud Services through Chef Knife.

The project is open source and maintained by Oracle Corp. The home page for the project is [here](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/SDKDocs/knifeplugin.htm).

## Commands

- Launch a BMCS instance and bootstrap it as a Chef node:
  `knife bmcs server create`
- List BMCS compartments.
  `knife bmcs compartment list`
- Delete a BMCS instance:
  `knife bmcs server delete`
- List BMCS instances in a given compartment. **Note:** All instances in the compartment are returned, not only those that are Chef nodes:
  `knife bmcs server list`
- List the images in a compartment:
  `knife bmcs image list`
- List the VCNs in a compartment:
  `knife bmcs vcn list`
- List the subnets in a VCN:
  `knife bmcs subnet list`
- List the shapes that may be used for a particular image type:
  `knife bmcs shape list`
- List the availability domains for your tenancy:
  `knife bmcs ad list`

## Requirements

Linux and Mac are supported. Windows is not supported at this time.

## Installation

Install from RubyGems with:

    chef gem install knife-bmcs

Or:

    gem install knife-bmcs

**Note:** The plugin depends on the Oracle BMCS Ruby SDK. Information about that SDK can be found [here](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/SDKDocs/rubysdk.htm).

## Setup

A config file is required to use Bare Metal Cloud Services commands. See the instructions for creating a config file [here](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm).

By default, the config file will be loaded from ~/.oraclebmc/config. Alternate locations can be provided as an argument to each command using `--bmcs-config-file`, or as an entry in your knife.rb file. You can also specify a profile with `--bmcs-profile`.

## Setting the Compartment

Each BMCS command requires a compartment ID, which will default to the root compartment. If you do not have the correct permissions and you do not specify a different compartment, then you will receive an authorization error.

A compartment ID can be provided with each BMCS command using `--compartment-id`, or it can be provided in your knife.rb. If a compartment ID is set in both places, then the ID specified in the command will take precedence.

## Knife.rb values

The following example shows the available knife.rb settings for the BMCS Knife Plugin. All of these are optional.

    knife[:bmcs_config_file] = '~/.oraclebmc/my_alternate_config'
    knife[:bmcs_profile] = 'MY_ALTERNATE_PROFILE'
    knife[:compartment_id] = 'ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaaaalsyenka3grgpvvmqwjshig5abzx3jnbvixxxzx373ehwdj7o5arc'

## Using the Server Create Command

The following example shows how to launch and bootstrap an Oracle Linux image:

    knife bmcs server create
      --availability-domain 'kIdk:PHX-AD-1'
      --compartment-id 'ocidv1:tenancy:oc1:phx:1460406592660:aaaaaaaab4faofrfkxecohhjuivjq26a13'
      --image-id 'ocid1.image.oc1.phx.aaaaaaaaqutj4qjxihpl4mboabsa27mrpusygv6gurp47katabcvljmq3puq'
      --shape 'VM.Standard1.1'
      --subnet-id 'ocid1.subnet.oc1.phx.aaaaaaaaxlc5cv7ewqr343ms4lvcpxr4lznsf4cbs2565abcm23d3cfebrex'
      --ssh-authorized-keys-file ~/.keys/instance_keys.pub
      --display-name myinstance
      --identity-file ~/.keys/instance_keys
      --run-list 'recipe[my_cookbook::my_recipe]'

When using the `knife bmcs server create` command, you must specify a public key using `--ssh-authorized-keys-file` and the corresponding private key using `--identity-file`. For more information, see [Managing Key Pairs on Linux Instances](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Compute/Tasks/managingkeypairs.htm).

Notes about the `knife bmcs server create` command:

 - All Oracle-provided Linux images are supported. Windows images are not supported at this time.
 - Bootstrapping is done through SSH only, and uses the public IP address.
 - For Ubuntu images, the user is usually 'ubuntu' instead of 'opc'.
